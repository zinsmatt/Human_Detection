# Human_Detection

The goal of this project was to detect persons in images.
I used HOG descriptor and cross-validation to train a Support Vector Machine.
Once trained, the SVM can classify images as person or not. The detection was made using a sliding window.
This detector was developed in Matlab.

#### Example of detection
